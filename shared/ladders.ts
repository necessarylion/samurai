 * drops you down. Like the other engines this one owns the only real state,
 * validates every action and hands back `{ok:false,error}` for anything it
 * rejects. The die is drawn from the `Rng`, so the generator is carried by
 * position the way Coup carries its deck — rolls happen all game long.

 * of snakes and ladders, not a copy of any published board.
